            <p>My name is Layla and this is my very basic portfolio using HTML and CSS.I live in Austin, TX and graduated with a BBA in Digital Media from St. Edward's University in 2015. The company that I currently work for, Ticketbud, is sponsoring my enrollment in UT Austin's Coding Boot Camp. I'm hoping to apply the skills that I learn in the next 6 months to expand my role in the company.Besides coding being a very useful technical skill that will hopefully, make me more money, I'm most excited to learn front-end web development.</br>
            
            </br>As a Support Supervisor at Ticketbud, I'm always helping our customers troubleshoot issues. With that, the aspect of UX/UI is something that I'm constantly thinking about. How can this be a better interface and experience for the customer? Learning how to code will give me the skills to make those thoughts a reality.
